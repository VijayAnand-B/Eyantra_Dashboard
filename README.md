This was one of the task in Eyantra Robotics Competition(2020-2021) in which I have simulated the Amazon Warehouse management using Robot Operating System (ROS), OpenCV, IoT(Used Protocol such as MQTT) ,Google App Script and built a Dashboard (using HTML,CSS,Javascript ) for monitoring stocks, shipping & delivery of products. </br>
